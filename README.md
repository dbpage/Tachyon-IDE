**Tachyon-IDE**

An IDE for Peter Jakacki's Tachyon FORTH for the Propeller. It contains a simple editor and a terminal with upload function.

For latest version and changes see changelog.md.

Roadmap:

Implement a help function for Tachyon words by parsing the HLP text files on the Tachyon dropbox site. Done.

Add UI function to select port and baudrate. Done.

Implemant full ANSI mode for terminal, at least what Tachynon is using.
